# Mini Message Board

## Objective

To become more familiar with Express and understand how to create routes, write controllers, and use views. Full details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-mini-message-board).

## Built With

- Express
- EJS

## Features

The message board displays all messages sent by users on the home page and users may send a new message using the form on the `/new` page. Users may open any message on the home page in a separate page to view details by clicking on the adjacent "Open" button.

Because this is a very bare bones app created for learning purposes, it is unstyled and is not user friendly. There is no navbar or sidebar with quick links to easily navigate between pages.
